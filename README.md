# IssueFirst

> **Understand the issue before you write the code.**

IssueFirst is a lightweight, beginner-friendly web tool that helps developers **analyze GitHub issues properly before starting implementation**. It encourages structured thinking and converts issue understanding into a **PR‑ready Markdown document**, making open‑source contributions clearer and more effective.

---

## 🚀 Why IssueFirst?

Many beginners jump directly into coding without fully understanding:

* what the issue actually means
* expected vs actual behavior
* how to explain their solution to maintainers

This often leads to:

* rejected PRs
* unnecessary rework
* poor communication with mentors

**IssueFirst solves this by forcing clarity before code.**

## ✨ Key Features

* 📝 **Structured Issue Analysis**
  Fill in repository name, issue link, and your understanding of the problem.

* 💾 **Local Storage Support**
  Your analysis is saved locally in the browser — no login, no backend.

* 📤 **Export as Markdown (.md)**
  Generates a GitHub‑style Markdown file that can be directly used in:

  * Pull Requests
  * Issue comments
  * Proposal drafts (GSoC / WOC / Hackathons)

* 🧩 **PR‑Ready Template**
  Includes sections like:

  * Problem Summary
