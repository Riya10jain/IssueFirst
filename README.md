# IssueFirst

IssueFirst is a small personal tool I built to help myself understand open-source issues properly *before* starting to code.

When I began contributing to open source, I realized that my biggest problem was not writing code, but understanding the issue clearly. I often jumped into coding without fully analyzing the problem, which led to confusion, wrong implementations, and wasted time.  
This project is my attempt to fix that habit.

## 🧠 What Problem Does It Solve?

Beginners usually face these problems:
- Issues look confusing or incomplete
- It’s hard to understand what is actually expected
- We start coding without a clear plan
- Mistakes are repeated across multiple contributions

IssueFirst encourages **thinking before coding** by breaking an issue into simple, guided questions.

## 💡 What IssueFirst Does

IssueFirst allows a contributor to create a short “issue analysis” before starting work.

For each issue, the user can record:
- Repository name
- Issue link
- Problem explanation in their own words
- Files or areas that might be affected
- Things that are not clear yet
- Planned approach to solve the issue
- What to verify after the fix

These entries can be saved and reviewed later to improve future contributions.
